/* store will need to include ...
more than the server, locally we'll need to store filter, error, and adding

expanded - boolean - expands bookmark to display the description, delete, and visit buttons

filter - number 1-5 filters bookmarks desplayed in DOM by minimum value selected

error - displays all !resp.ok messages and any server errors

adding - boolean - form to add new bookmark

const store = {
  bookmarks: [...],
  adding: true,
  error: null,
  filter: 0
};

bookmarks: [
    {
      id: '7ddr',
      title: 'Title 11',
      rating: 5,
      url: 'http://www.title11.com',
      description: 'lorem ipsum dolor',
      expanded: true
    }
